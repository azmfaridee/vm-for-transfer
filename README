Wiki Pendig Works:
-----------------------
- New instructions to add in the wiki: 
    - mlu, incini, incin, and, or, not, storev, concat, chunk, lu

Compiler Pending Works:
-----------------------
- [DONE] All the 'addtrie' commands must be together
    - [DONE] current implementation has pattern1, action1, pattern2, action2 seqeunce we want pattern1, pattern2, action1, action2
    
    = [NOTE: NOT NEEDED, this will be handled internally by the VM] 
    - after an action has been performed for a pattern, the vm needs to return so that it can resume processing through the remaining patterns
        - at the end of all 'addtrie' instructions
            - put a jmp to jump to the end of file
        - at the end of any rule
            - put a jmp to run immediately below the addtrie
            
- when/otherwise breaks sometimes :(
     - [HIGH PRIORITY]
        - most of the time "otherwise_\d+_end" label
    

- tags that have not been implemented:
    - modify-case
    - case-of
    - begins-with
    - ends-with
    - contains-substring
    - get-case-from

VM Pending Works
-----------------------
- Change the search algo in the Trie
- hlt stops the vm now in one iteration, but it should not be doing exactly this
    - we want the vm to loop over the our codesegment until input text is exhausted
- Implement a evenhandler like class in the vm to ensure more compactness
- Provide proper unicode processing capability
    - LOW PRIORITY
- [DONE ]We need a preprocessror in the CodeSegment class
    - a scan through unlinked code will produce the necessary labels prior to calling the linker

Debugging:
