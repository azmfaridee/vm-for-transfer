Wiki Pendig Works:
-----------------------
- New instructions to add in the wiki: 
    - mlu, incini, incin, and, or, not, storev, concat, chunk, lu

Compiler Pending Works:
-----------------------
- All the 'addtrie' commands must be together
    - current implementation has pattern1, action1, pattern2, action2 seqeunce
    - we want patter1, patter2, action1, action2
    - after an action has been performed for a pattern, the vm needs to return so that it can resume processing through the remaining patterns
        - at the end of all 'addtrie' instructions
            - put a jmp to jump to the end of file
        - at the end of any rule
            - put a jmp to run immediately below the addtrie
- when/otherwise breaks sometimes :(
- tags that have not been implemented:
    - modify-case
    - case-of
    - begins-with
    - ends-with
    - contains-substring
    - get-case-from

VM Pending Works
-----------------------
- Change the search algo in the Trie

Debugging:
